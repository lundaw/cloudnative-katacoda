# HSN Kubernetes powered by Katacoda
This repository contains the Katacoda scenario and required assets to the [HSN k8s lab](http://hsn.tmit.bme.hu/k8s/kubernetes_intro.html).

It is based on a basic Ubuntu 20.04 Docker image at Katacoda and prepares the environment with a bash script. In the other steps, it follows the original one.

The Katacoda scenario is available at [HSN k8s intro](https://katacoda.com/lundaw/scenarios/hsn-k8s-intro).
