In this scenario, you are going to use some basic Kubernetes (k8s from now on) commands and experiment with the k8s orchestration and management.

You will create a simple web server Docker image and run it in k8s, scale it and experiment with the redundancy of it.

This scenario is a remake of the [original HSN exercise](http://hsn.tmit.bme.hu/k8s/kubernetes_intro.html).
