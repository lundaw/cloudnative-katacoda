In this scenario, you are going to use some basic Kubernetes (k8s from now on) commands and experiment with the k8s orchestration and management. You will create a simple web server Docker image and run it in k8s, scale it and experiment with the redundancy of it.

The files you are going to create during the scenario are also prepared for you in the `prepared` directory in your home folder.

This scenario is a remake of the [original HSN exercise](http://hsn.tmit.bme.hu/k8s/kubernetes_intro.html).
