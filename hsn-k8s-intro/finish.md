Congratulations, you have finished the HSN k8s intro exercise.

Now you have some basic level of k8s container handling and why is it beneficial. Also experienced an operator and how you can extend the k8s functionality with them through for example with python code.

Feel free to stay here and play around with the results or start a fresh one and try out different things.
